FifthEstate connects our partner WordPress.org blogs to fifthestate.com, so posts can be viewed by FifthEstate users worldwide.  Join today!

== Description ==
FifthEstate is an international social media platform that features the best of independent media and the blogosphere.  We use a revenue sharing model to reward content contributors for high quality content.  We would love for you to be part of our team.

The way this works is simple:  Sign up on fifthestate.com, then download and install this plugin (it just takes a minute).  The plugin will send your new content to FifthEstate from your WordPress.org site.  Thatâ€™s it.

You maintain complete control.  The plugin does not take previously published content. You choose which new content gets published and when.  You can edit, update, or delete your content either on your blog or on FifthEstate.  You can disconnect at any time.

We track the popularity of your content on FifthEstate.com, and compensate you with 50%-80% of the associated revenues.  There are no catches.  Learn more at https://fifthestate.com.
